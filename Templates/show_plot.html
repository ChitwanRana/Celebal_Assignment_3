      <p class="mt-2">
        {% if 'survival_count' in image_file %}
          This bar chart shows the number of people who survived vs those who didnâ€™t. It provides a quick snapshot of the survival rate on the Titanic.
        {% elif 'age_distribution' in image_file %}
          This histogram shows how passenger ages were distributed. The smooth curve (KDE) helps spot common age groups onboard.
        {% elif 'class_pie' in image_file %}
          This pie chart displays the percentage of passengers in First, Second, and Third class. It highlights how the ship was socially structured.
        {% elif 'boxplot_age_class' in image_file %}
          This box plot compares the age distribution across each passenger class. It shows medians, ranges, and outliers per class.
        {% elif 'violin_age_survival' in image_file %}
          This violin plot compares the age spread of survivors and non-survivors. The shape shows how concentrated the age groups were.
        {% elif 'heatmap_corr' in image_file %}
          This heatmap shows correlations between numeric features like age, fare, and survival. A brighter color means stronger correlation.
        {% elif 'scatter_fare_age' in image_file %}
          This scatter plot shows fare paid vs passenger age. Points are colored by survival status to explore any trends.
        {% elif 'embarked_class' in image_file %}
          This bar chart compares embarkation ports (C, Q, S) with class levels. It tells us which classes boarded from which locations.
        {% elif 'swarm_age_sex_survival' in image_file %}
          This swarm plot visualizes each passengerâ€™s age, gender, and survival. You can spot patterns by how the points group.
        {% elif 'boxen_fare_embarked' in image_file %}
          This boxen plot shows the distribution of fares by embarkation point. It reveals how fare varied per boarding port.
        {% else %}
          This graph provides useful insight into the Titanic dataset.
